              "When I was a kid, my dad used to leave me little voice notes.
              ‘Stay strong, kiddo.’ ‘You got this.’ ‘I’m proud of you.’ After he
              passed, I was terrified I’d forget the way he sounded. I’d play
              his old voicemails over and over, afraid that one day, they’d stop
              being enough. With Eternal, I don’t just have recordings—I have a
              way to hear his words when I need them most. When I feel lost, I
              can go back and be reminded of what he would have told me. It’s
              not about pretending he’s still here. It’s about remembering that
              his love, his wisdom, his support—they never really left.”

              “My best friend knew me better than anyone. We used to have these
              late-night conversations about everything—life, love, our dreams.
              When she passed, I felt like I had lost a part of myself. Eternal
              gave me a way to hold onto our conversations. I can still hear her
              laugh, still read her words, still feel her presence in moments
              when I need her most. It’s not about living in the past. It’s
              about keeping the love alive.”
            </p>
            <p className="section-descr mb-30">
              “When we got married, my wife used to say, ‘No matter what
              happens, I’ll always be with you.’ I held onto those words through
              every joy, every challenge, every quiet moment we shared. When she
              passed away, the silence was unbearable. I missed our late-night
              talks, the way she reassured me after a long day, the little
              messages she’d send just to make me smile. With Eternal, I can
              still hear her voice, still read her words, still feel her
              presence in my life. It doesn’t replace her, but it reminds me
              that love doesn’t disappear—it stays, it lingers, it finds its way
              back to you when you need it most.”
