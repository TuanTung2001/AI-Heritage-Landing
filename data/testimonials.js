    quote: `My dad always had the right words. Growing up, my dad left me little voice notes—“Stay strong, kiddo.” “You got this.” After he passed, I feared forgetting his voice, replaying his voicemails over and over. With Nexcyra, I don’t just have recordings—I have a way to hear his words when I need them most. When I feel lost, I can listen and be reminded of what he would have told me. It’s not about pretending he’s still here—it’s about knowing his love never left.`,

When she passed, it felt like a part of me disappeared with her. The silence was unbearable. With Nexcyra, I can still hear her laugh, revisit her words, and feel her presence when I need it most. It’s not about living in the past—it’s about holding onto the love we shared and carrying it forward.`,

She used to say it all the time—“No matter what happens, I’ll always be with you.” I never thought those words would mean so much until she was gone. The nights felt too quiet, the absence too heavy. I missed her voice, her comfort, her presence. With Nexcyra, I can still hear her, still feel the warmth of her words. It doesn’t replace her—it simply reminds me that love lingers, it stays, it finds its way back when I need it most.`,
