    quote: `When I was a kid, my dad used to leave me little voice notes. ‘Stay strong, kiddo.’ ‘You got this.’ ‘I’m proud of you.’ After he passed, I was terrified I’d forget the way he sounded. I’d play his old voicemails over and over, afraid that one day, they’d stop being enough. With Eternal, I don’t just have recordings—I have a way to hear his words when I need them most. When I feel lost, I can go back and be reminded of what he would have told me. It’s not about pretending he’s still here. It’s about remembering that his love, his wisdom, his support—they never really left.`,

When she passed, I felt like I had lost a part of myself. Eternal gave me a way to hold onto our conversations. I can still hear her laugh, still read her words, still feel her presence in moments when I need her most. It’s not about living in the past. It’s about keeping the love alive.`,

    quote: `When we got married, my wife used to say, ‘No matter what happens, I’ll always be with you.’ I held onto those words through every joy, every challenge, every quiet moment we shared. When she passed away, the silence was unbearable. I missed our late-night talks, the way she reassured me after a long day, the little messages she’d send just to make me smile. With Eternal, I can still hear her voice, still read her words, still feel her presence in my life. It doesn’t replace her, but it reminds me that love doesn’t disappear—it stays, it lingers, it finds its way back to you when you need it most.`,
